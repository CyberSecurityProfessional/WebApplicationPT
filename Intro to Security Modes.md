# Intro to Security Modes
* Offensive Security:
```
In short, offensive security is the process of breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access to them.
To beat a hacker, you need to behave like a hacker, finding vulnerabilities and recommending patches before a cybercriminal does, as you'll do in this room!

Offensive security focuses on one thing: breaking into systems.
Breaking into systems might be achieved through exploiting bugs, abusing insecure setups, and taking advantage of unenforced access control policies, among other things.
Red teams and penetration testers specialize in offensive security.
```
* Defensive Security:
```
On the flip side, there is also defensive security, which is the process of protecting an organization's network and computer systems by analyzing and securing any potential digital threats; learn more in the digital forensics room.
In a defensive cyber role, you could be investigating infected computers or devices to understand how it was hacked, tracking down cybercriminals, or monitoring infrastructure for malicious activity.

Defensive security is somewhat the opposite of offensive security, as it is concerned with two main tasks:
1. Preventing intrusions from occurring
2. Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly
Blue teams are part of the defensive security landscape.
```
* Some of the tasks that are related to defensive security include:
```
1. User cyber security awareness: Training users about cyber security helps protect against various attacks that target their systems.
2. Documenting and managing assets: We need to know the types of systems and devices that we have to manage and protect properly.
3. Updating and patching systems: Ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and patched against any known vulnerability (weakness).
4. Setting up preventative security devices: firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are critical components of preventative security. Firewalls control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network. IPS blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures.
5. Setting up logging and monitoring devices: Without proper logging and monitoring of the network, it won’t be possible to detect malicious activities and intrusions. If a new unauthorized device appears on our network, we should be able to know.
> There is much more to defensive security, and the list above only covers a few common topics.

```
> Security Operations Center (SOC)
  Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of IT security professionals tasked with monitoring, preventing , detecting , investigating, and responding to threats within a company’s network and systems.

* Security Operations Center (SOC)
```
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events.
Some of the main areas of interest for a SOC are:
1. Vulnerabilities: Whenever a system vulnerability (weakness) is discovered, it is essential to fix it by installing a proper update or patch.
    When a fix is not available, the necessary measures should be taken to prevent an attacker from exploiting it.
    Although remediating vulnerabilities is of vital interest to a SOC, it is not necessarily assigned to them.
2. Policy violations: We can think of a security policy as a set of rules required for the protection of the network and systems.
    For example, it might be a policy violation if users start uploading confidential company data to an online storage service.
3. Unauthorized activity: Consider the case where a user’s login name and password are stolen, and the attacker uses them to log into the network.
    A SOC needs to detect such an event and block it as soon as possible before further damage is done.
4. Network intrusions: No matter how good your security is, there is always a chance for an intrusion.
    An intrusion can occur when a user clicks on a malicious link or when an attacker exploits a public server.
    Either way, when an intrusion occurs, we must detect it as soon as possible to prevent further damage.
> Security operations cover various tasks to ensure protection; one such task is threat intelligence.
```
* Threat Intelligence
```
In this context, intelligence refers to information you gather about actual and potential enemies.
A threat is any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a system.
Threat intelligence aims to gather information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries.
The purpose would be to achieve a threat-informed defense. Different companies have different adversaries.
Some adversaries might seek to steal customer data from a mobile operator; however, other adversaries are interested in halting the production in a petroleum refinery.
Example adversaries include a nation-state cyber army working for political reasons and a ransomware group acting for financial purposes.
Based on the company (target), we can expect adversaries.
Intelligence needs data. Data has to be collected, processed, and analyzed.
Data collection is done from local sources such as network logs and public sources such as forums.
Processing of data aims to arrange them into a format suitable for analysis.
The analysis phase seeks to find more information about the attackers and their motives; moreover, it aims to create a list of recommendations and actionable steps.

Learning about your adversaries allows you to know their tactics, techniques, and procedures.
As a result of threat intelligence, we identify the threat actor (adversary), predict their activity, and consequently, we will be able to mitigate their attacks and prepare a response strategy.
