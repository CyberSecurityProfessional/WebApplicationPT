# Introduction to Pentesting
```
Understand what a penetration test involves, including testing techniques and methodologies every pentester should know.

This module will teach you the various methodologies and testing techniques that every penetration tester should know.
By the end of the module, you will be able to identify what framework best suits your pentest engagement and
know what security policies are used to protect data from cyber threats; involving keeping data confidential, integral, and available.

## Pentesting Fundamentals
* What is Penetration Testing?
```
> Before teaching you the technical hands-on aspects of ethical hacking, you'll need to understand more about what a penetration tester's job responsibilities are and what processes are followed in performing pentests (finding vulnerabilities in a clients application or system).
> The importance and relevancy of cybersecurity are ever-increasing and can be in every walk of life. News headlines fill our screens, reporting yet another hack or data leak.
> Cybersecurity is relevant to all people in the modern world, including a strong password policy to protect your emails or to businesses and other organisations needing to protect both devices and data from damages.
> A Penetration test or pentest is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyse the security defences to protect these assets and pieces of information. A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.
> According to Security Magazine, a cybersecurity industry magazine, there are over 2,200 cyber attacks every day - 1 attack every 39 seconds. - https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/87787-hackers-attack-every-39-seconds

* Penetration Testing Ethics
```
The battle of legality and ethics in cybersecurity, let alone penetration testing is always controversial.
Labels like "hacking" and "hacker" often hold negative connotations, especially in pop culture, thanks to a few bad apples.
The idea of legally gaining access to a computer system is a challenging concept to grasp -- after all, what makes it legal exactly?

Recall that a penetration test is an authorised audit of a computer system's security and defences as agreed by the owners of the systems.
The legality of penetration is pretty clear-cut in this sense; anything that falls outside of this agreement is deemed unauthorised.

Before a penetration test starts, a formal discussion occurs between the penetration tester and the system owner.
Various tools, techniques, and systems to be tested are agreed on.
This discussion forms the scope of the penetration testing agreement and will determine the course the penetration test takes.

Companies that provide penetration testing services are held against legal frameworks and industry accreditation.
For example, the National Cyber   Security Centre (NCSC) has the CHECK accreditation scheme in the UK.
This check means that only "[CHECK]  approved companies can conduct authorised penetration tests of public sector and CNI systems and networks." (NCSC).  

Ethics is the moral debate between right and wrong; where an action may be legal, it may go against an individual's belief system of right and wrong.

Penetration testers will often be faced with potentially morally questionable decisions during a penetration test.
For example, they are gaining access to a database and being presented with potentially sensitive data. Or they are, perhaps, performing a phishing attack on an employee to test an organisation's human security.
If that action has been agreed upon during the initial stages, it is legal -- however ethically questionable.

Hackers are sorted into three hats, where their ethics and motivations behind their actions determine what hat category they are placed into.
Let's cover these three in the table below:

> White Hat:
    These hackers are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.
    For example, a penetration tester performing an authorised engagement on a company.
> Grey Hat:
    These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times.
    For example, someone taking down a scamming site.
>Black Hat:
    These people  are criminals and often seek to damage organisations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others.
    For example, ransomware authors infect devices with malicious code and hold data for ransom.
```
* Rules of Engagement (ROE):
```
The Rules of Engagement is a document that gives permission to a penetration tester, defining the targets that the engagement applies to and the behaviours/techniques that
https://tryhackme.com/room/pentestingfundamentals

The ROE is a document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement.
This document consists of three main sections (explained in the table below), which are ultimately responsible for deciding how the engagement is carried out.
The SANS institute has a great example of this document which you can view online at https://sansorg.egnyte.com/dl/bF4I3yCcnt/?

> Permission:
  This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out.
  This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organisations for the activities they carry out.
> Test Scope:
  This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply.
  For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.
> Rules:	The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement.
  For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay.

MITM: A Man in the Middle attack involves an individual placing themselves in-between a communication process to intercept traffic
