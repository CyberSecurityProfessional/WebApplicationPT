## Pentesting Fundamentals
* What is Penetration Testing?
```
> Before teaching you the technical hands-on aspects of ethical hacking, you'll need to understand more about what a penetration tester's job responsibilities are and what processes are followed in performing pentests (finding vulnerabilities in a clients application or system).
> The importance and relevancy of cybersecurity are ever-increasing and can be in every walk of life. News headlines fill our screens, reporting yet another hack or data leak.
> Cybersecurity is relevant to all people in the modern world, including a strong password policy to protect your emails or to businesses and other organisations needing to protect both devices and data from damages.
> A Penetration test or pentest is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyse the security defences to protect these assets and pieces of information. A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.
> According to Security Magazine, a cybersecurity industry magazine, there are over 2,200 cyber attacks every day - 1 attack every 39 seconds. - https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/87787-hackers-attack-every-39-seconds
