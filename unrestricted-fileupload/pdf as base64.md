Applicable security testcases while uploading pdf file as base64 data:
When uploading a **PDF file as base64 data**, there are several security concerns that you should address to ensure that the system is protected against potential attacks. These test cases should cover various aspects of data validation, integrity, and security risks that could arise from uploading or processing base64-encoded PDF files.

Here are some **security test cases** you should consider for this scenario:

### 1. **Base64 Validation**
   - **Test Case:** Ensure that the uploaded data is valid **base64-encoded**.
   - **Objective:** The server should properly validate that the uploaded data is indeed base64-encoded and not malformed. Malicious users could attempt to inject non-base64 content to exploit vulnerabilities.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Upload a valid base64-encoded PDF file.
     2. Upload data that is not valid base64 (e.g., strings with invalid characters).
     3. Ensure that only valid base64 data is accepted and that any invalid input is rejected.

### 2. **File Type Verification (PDF Check)**
   - **Test Case:** Validate that the decoded content corresponds to a valid PDF file.
   - **Objective:** Even though the data is base64-encoded, it still needs to be checked for validity as a PDF document. An attacker could encode non-PDF content into the base64 string, or attempt to upload an executable or malicious file disguised as a PDF.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Decode the base64-encoded string back to its binary form.
     2. Verify that the file is a valid PDF by checking the file signature (e.g., the file should start with `%PDF`).
     3. Reject any invalid or non-PDF files.

### 3. **File Size Limits**
   - **Test Case:** Enforce file size limits for the uploaded PDF.
   - **Objective:** Ensure that very large base64-encoded PDF files do not overload the server or cause denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities. Base64 encoding increases the file size by approximately 33%.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Upload PDF files that exceed the defined size limit (e.g., 10MB).
     2. Ensure that files exceeding the allowed size are rejected with a proper error message.
     3. Test with base64-encoded PDFs that, after decoding, exceed the file size limit.

### 4. **Malicious PDF Content**
   - **Test Case:** Check for potential malicious content or exploits within the PDF.
   - **Objective:** PDFs can be used to deliver malicious payloads, such as JavaScript or malware. It’s crucial to scan for embedded scripts, links, or other malicious elements in the PDF.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Upload PDFs containing potentially malicious elements (e.g., embedded JavaScript, phishing links, or executable code).
     2. Use antivirus scanners or PDF security tools (e.g., **PDFiD**, **Peepdf**) to check for malicious content.
     3. Ensure the system sanitizes or rejects PDFs that contain harmful or suspicious content.

### 5. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in PDF Metadata**
   - **Test Case:** Ensure that PDF metadata (such as author, title, or subject) is sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.
   - **Objective:** PDFs can contain metadata that may include user-generated content. If not properly sanitized, this could be exploited in an XSS attack.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Upload a PDF containing malicious JavaScript in its metadata fields (e.g., title, author).
     2. Test if the system can render the PDF without executing any script or redirecting the user to a malicious site.
     3. Ensure that metadata is either stripped or sanitized before rendering the PDF.

### 6. **Path Traversal in Embedded Resources**
   - **Test Case:** Ensure that the PDF file does not contain **path traversal** references that could affect the server file system.
   - **Objective:** PDFs can contain references to external resources or files, such as images or scripts. If these resources reference locations outside the server’s allowed directory, it could result in path traversal vulnerabilities.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Upload a PDF with references to external files using relative or absolute paths (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`).
     2. Ensure that the application correctly handles or rejects such references.
     3. Test if the PDF is able to make unauthorized requests to system files or directories.

### 7. **Content-Type Validation**
   - **Test Case:** Verify that the server correctly processes and validates the `Content-Type` header for base64 PDF uploads.
   - **Objective:** Ensure that the system does not misinterpret the uploaded content type. For example, an attacker might try to disguise a malicious file as a PDF by using a custom `Content-Type` header.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Upload a PDF file with the correct `Content-Type` (`application/pdf`).
     2. Upload base64-encoded content with a modified or incorrect `Content-Type`.
     3. Verify that the system checks the content type and only accepts data with the correct type.

### 8. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**
   - **Test Case:** Ensure that the file upload is protected against **CSRF attacks**.
   - **Objective:** CSRF attacks can occur when an attacker tricks a user into submitting a request to upload a PDF without their knowledge or consent.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Test the upload functionality with a forged request from an external website to see if unauthorized uploads can be made.
     2. Ensure that CSRF tokens are used to protect the upload form or endpoint.
     3. Verify that users are properly authenticated before allowing PDF uploads.

### 9. **Access Control**
   - **Test Case:** Verify that **access control** mechanisms are in place to prevent unauthorized access to uploaded PDF files.
   - **Objective:** Ensure that only authorized users can upload or download PDFs, and that users cannot access files they don't have permission to.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Upload a PDF file as an authenticated user.
     2. Try to access the uploaded file as an unauthorized user and ensure access is denied.
     3. Ensure that proper authorization checks are in place when retrieving or modifying files.

### 10. **Secure Transmission (TLS/SSL)**
   - **Test Case:** Ensure that PDF uploads are done over **secure channels** (HTTPS).
   - **Objective:** Sensitive data, including files uploaded as base64, should always be transmitted over a secure channel to prevent eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Upload a base64-encoded PDF over HTTP (insecure) and confirm that the system rejects the request or redirects to HTTPS.
     2. Ensure that the connection is encrypted using TLS/SSL (HTTPS).

### 11. **File Integrity Check**
   - **Test Case:** Verify the **integrity** of the uploaded PDF.
   - **Objective:** Ensure that the uploaded PDF has not been tampered with during the upload process.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Calculate the hash (e.g., MD5, SHA256) of the original PDF before uploading.
     2. After the PDF is uploaded, check the hash of the decoded file to ensure it matches the original.
     3. Reject any file whose integrity does not match the original content.

### Conclusion
When allowing users to upload a PDF file as base64 data, it's critical to implement various security checks to prevent malicious activity, data corruption, and unauthorized access. The security test cases outlined above aim to address common vulnerabilities associated with file uploads, such as validating file types, ensuring safe content, and protecting against attacks like XSS, CSRF, and path traversal. Always ensure that user inputs, such as file uploads, are rigorously validated and sanitized to maintain a secure system.
